## Jenkinsfile Documentation

This document outlines the purpose and functionality of the Jenkinsfile provided below. The Jenkinsfile is designed to automate the process of updating software, installing and starting the Apache web server, testing the web server's connection, and running a custom script to check for specific HTTP status codes in the Apache error log.

### Pipeline Structure

### Agent

- The pipeline is configured to run on a Jenkins agent labeled as 'centos-agent'. This means the pipeline's steps will be executed on a CentOS-based Jenkins agent.

### Stages

#### Stage: Update

- Purpose: This stage updates the software packages installed on the Jenkins agent.
- Steps:
  - Executes the command `sudo dnf update` to update the software from the system repositories.

#### Stage: Install

- Purpose: This stage installs the Apache web server.
- Steps:
  - Executes the command `sudo dnf install httpd -y` to install the Apache web server without manual confirmation (`-y` flag).

#### Stage: Start Web Server

- Steps:
  - Executes the command `service httpd status` to check the status of the Apache web server.

#### Stage: Running script

- Purpose: This stage runs a custom Bash script to check for specific HTTP status codes in the Apache error log.
- Steps:
  - Changes the permissions of the script file using `chmod +x check-codes-apachelog`.
  - Executes the custom script `./check-codes-apachelog` to check for 4xx and 5xx status codes in the Apache error log.

### Conclusion

This Jenkinsfile automates the process of updating software packages, installing and starting the Apache web server, testing its connection, and running a custom script for monitoring HTTP status codes in the Apache error log. It provides a streamlined workflow for managing web server deployments and monitoring in a continuous integration environment.
